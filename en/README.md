# Node.js in action

**English version is not ready yet**

This is a tiny book about Node.js. It aims to help the ones who are new to Node.js to learn to create their own Node.js projects and have fun coding with it.

I will try hard to explain things in brief sentences and brings your three tutorial of developing Node.js projects. You would learn a lot during the reading period.

> **NOTE**: If you meet problems about Node.js and NPM, refer to the  sections in appendix: [Node.js basics](../appendix/basic.md) and [NPM basics](../appendix/npm.md)

And if you have any question or doubt about my poor English, feel free to create issues on the book's [Github](https://github.com/SFantasy/node-in-action/issues) or send [E-mail to me](mailto:fantasyshao@icloud.com).
